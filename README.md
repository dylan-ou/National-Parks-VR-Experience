# National Parks VR Experience

This document was the semester-long "development" project 
for CS 440: Software Engineering 1 at the University of 
Illinois at Chicago. The entire document was made by me,
Krystian Stanuch, Patricia Guerra, and Aakash Kotak to
understand the process of making documentation within the
context of software development.
